		<h1>Kedhar App Development Studios(KADS) Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p><i>Effective date: April 12th, 2021</i></p>
		
		<p>It is a pleasure to see that you are using our products. Protecting your privacy and personal data while using KADS's applications and our other products is very important to us. Therefore, we adhere strictly to the rules of data protection laws. We collect personal data only insofar as necessary for the use of our services. The following explanations help you understand how we ensure this protection and which data is collected and for what purpose.</p>
		
		<h2>Types of Data collected</h2>
		<p>Among the types of Personal Data that KADS. collects, by itself or through third-parties, there are: General Activity Data, Cookies, Location and Usage Data.</p>
		<p>Other Personal Data collected may be described in other sections of this privacy policy or by dedicated explanation text contextually with the Data collection.</p>
		<p>The Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or collected automatically when using KADS.</p>
		<p>Any use of Cookies - or of other tracking tools - by KADS. or by the owners of third-party services used by KADS., unless stated otherwise, serves to identify Users and remember their preferences, for the sole purpose of providing the service required by the User.</p>
		<p>Failure to provide certain Personal Data may make it impossible for KADS. to provide its services.</p>
		
		<h2>Use of KADS. and sharing personal data</h2>
		<p>We also collect information that you do not actively provide us with. We store data in an anonymous form that include the behaviour of users when using our app. These include operating life, device and functions used. These analyses are available to us in anonymous form without reference to a specific user and only serve statistical purposes.</p>
		<p>A transfer of your data beyond the cases mentioned above will not take place. Also, we will not use your data for advertising purposes or let them be used by third-parties.</p>
		<p>Your personal information is not used by KADS. for marketing and advertising or transferred to third-parties.</p>
		
		<h2>Location Services</h2>
		<p>If you allow these services we may detect your approximate current location. To achieve this, these services may use any of the following: Cell ID, GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth beacons.</p>
		<p>We use this information to provide location-based services, not to identify you. Location services are used to</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Provide you with local search results.</li>
			<li>Provide you content based upon your location.</li>
			<li>To help improve recommendations.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In addition, and as with most location-enabled applications, we and our third-party partners may access your location when you use KADS's applications. Changes to these setting can be made through the Settings App.</p>

		<h2>OpenWeather Ltd</h2>
		<p>KADS. uses a third-party service provider OpenWeather Ltd as a weather information provider. We may submit anonymous and low accuracy location data with OpenWeather Ltd in order to obtain weather information.</p>

		<h2>Google Firebase Analytics</h2>
		<p>KADS. uses third-party service providers, such as Google Firebase Analytics in order to create accurate, real-time user data reports, so that KADS. can continue to improve the user experience of KADS's applications.

		<h2>How We Protect Information</h2>
		<p>We take several measures to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect. These steps depend on the sensitivity of the data that we collect, process, and store. Although we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content. Please, bear in mind that no system is 100% secure.</p>
		<p>KADS. uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information. KADS. engages a company that is an industry leader in online verification to strengthen the security. KADS. is registered with site identification authorities so that your mobile device can confirm KADS’s identity before any personally identifiable information is sent.</p>

		<p>If you are a resident of the European Union or a country/region with similar laws, you will start to see these applications prompt you for consent related to activities that require the collection and processing of your Sensitive Personal Data – as well as the transfer of your Personal Data.
